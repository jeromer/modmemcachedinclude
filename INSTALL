What is this extension made for ?
=================================

This module may be used with any file that is pushed
in Memcached and meant to be fetched from an SSI tag.

How to compile this extension ?
===============================
You will have to install and compiler apr_memcache first.
This module uses version 0.7.0 do not use older versions.
apr_memcache may be downloaded here : 

- http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/libs/apr_memcache/
- http://www.outoforder.cc/downloads/apr_memcache/apr_memcache-0.7.0.tar.bz2

Once apr_memcache is downloaded, extract it and compile it.

Note the path where it has been installed, you will need it.

Run 

::

        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install

Depending on your system and your apr_memcache installation path
you may need to specify the following arguments for the configure script:

--with-apxs=/path/to/apache/bin/apxs
--with-apr-memcache=/path/to/apr_memcache/
       
For example here is my configuration

::

        ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache-2.2.9/bin/apxs \
                    --with-apr-memcache=/opt/local/

Once everything is compiled, restart Apache

How to test this extension ?
============================
In order to test the extension you have to first compile
the module and install it, once you are done you have to 
launch test/push.php to store some contents in Memcached.
You can configure your Memcached host by editing push.php

After that you may create the following configuration
for Apache : 

::

        LoadModule memcached_include_module modules/mod_memcached_include.so
        <Directory /path/to/mod_memcached_include/tests/>
                AddType text/html .shtml
                AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml
                Options +Includes
                MemcachedHost localhost:11211
        </Directory>

Once the file is stored in Memcached, you can ``test/pull-*.shtml``
files.
