What is this extension made for ?
=================================

This module may be used with any file that is pushed
in Memcached and meant to be fetched from an SSI tag.

How to compile this extension ?
===============================
You will have to install and compiler apr_memcache first.
This module uses version 0.7.0 do not use older versions.
apr_memcache may be downloaded here : 

- http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/libs/apr_memcache/
- http://www.outoforder.cc/downloads/apr_memcache/apr_memcache-0.7.0.tar.bz2

Once apr_memcache is downloaded, extract it and compile it.

Note the path where it has been installed, you will need it.

Unfortunately I did not had time to create a configure script.
I wish I had some spare time to fix this issue as soon as possible.

In order to compile the extension you will have to edit the Makefile.

Change the following contents : 

::

        builddir=.
        top_srcdir=/usr/local/apache-2.2.9
        top_builddir=/usr/local/apache-2.2.9
        include /usr/local/apache-2.2.9/build/special.mk

        #   the used tools
        APXS=apxs
        APACHECTL=apache2ctl

        #   additional defines, includes and libraries
        #DEFS=-DDEBUG_MEMCACHED_INCLUDE
        DEFS=
        INCLUDES=-I/usr/local/apache-2.2.9/include/apr_memcache-0
        LIBS=-L/usr/local/apache-2.2.9/lib -lapr_memcache

By the following :

::

        builddir=.
        top_srcdir=/path/to/your/apache/installtion/directory
        top_builddir=/path/to/your/apache/installation/directory
        include /path/to/your/apache/installation/build/special.mk

        #   the used tools
        APXS=apxs
        APACHECTL=apachectl

        #   additional defines, includes and libraries
        #DEFS=-DDEBUG_MEMCACHED_INCLUDE
        DEFS=
        INCLUDES=-I/path/to/apr_memcache/installation/directory/apr_memcache-0
        LIBS=-L/path/to/your/apr_memcache/installation/directory/lib -lapr_memcache

How to test this extension ?
============================
In order to test the extension you have to first compile
the module and install it, once you are done you have to 
launch test/push.php to store some contents in Memcached.
You can configure your Memcached host by editing push.php

After that you may create the following configuration
for Apache : 

::

        LoadModule memcached_include_module modules/mod_memcached_include.so
        <Directory /path/to/mod_memcached_include/tests/>
                AddType text/html .shtml
                AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml
                Options +Includes
                MemcachedHost localhost:11211
        </Directory>

Once the file is stored in Memcached, you can ``test/pull-*.shtml``
files.
