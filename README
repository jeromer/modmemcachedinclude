History of this project.

At the very beginning this module was made for a customer.
But he decided not to use this module for some reason.

So I decided to open this project to anyone interested by SSIs and Memcached.

At the beginning the module was sort of a big patch integrated directly
into mod_include, this is why it was required to disable mod_include in order
to use it.

After a few months I decided to rewrite everything because it looked too inelegant to me.
This is why I decided to create the "ssi_include_memcached" branche which is the future
of this project, I changed its name as I found "ssi_include_memcached" to be more relevant and self explanatory.

This branche will be integrated back in trunk in a near future.
